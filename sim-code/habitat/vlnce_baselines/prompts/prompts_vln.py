LA_PROMPT_BACKTRACK = """Based on the text instruction, navigation history, current 4-directional views, and the TODO list,
decide the next action. If appropriate, suggest incremental updates to the TODO list.

Current TODO List:
{todo_list}

{feedback}

Task:
1. FIRST, write `reasoning_todo`: review ALL TODO items (not just the first one) and
   decide what to update. Items have only two statuses: "pending" and "completed".
   Sub-goals may be completed out of order or implicitly as you navigate.
   For each item, ask: "Based on what I've observed so far, is this item done?"
   - If yes: in `todo_updates`, mark it `completed` with a concrete `result` describing
     the observation that confirms completion (e.g., "Exited via left door at Waypoint 1,
     now in hallway").
   - IMPORTANT: If you mark a LATER item `completed`, re-examine EARLIER items —
     they may have been done implicitly while you traversed.
   - Use `op:rewrite` to refine an item based on new observations.
   - Use `op:add` to introduce a new sub-goal: omit `index` to append at the end,
     or include `index` to inject at that position (later items shift down).
   - Use `op:remove` to drop irrelevant ones.
   - `completed` WITHOUT a concrete `result` will be rolled back.

2. THEN, write `reasoning_action` and choose `action`: based on the UPDATED TODO
   (after applying your `todo_updates`), the instruction, and observations,
   reason about what to do next, then pick one action.
   Choose one of these actions:
{action_list}

Response format (JSON — strictly in this order):
{{
    "progress_analysis": "<brief assessment of what you've observed and done so far>",
    "reasoning_todo": "<reasoning behind the TODO updates: which items now satisfied, which need rewrite, etc.>",
    "todo_updates": [  // include any needed updates; use [] if nothing changes
        {{"index": <int>, "status": "completed", "result": "<REQUIRED observation>"}},
        {{"op": "rewrite", "index": <int>, "content": "<refined description>"}},

Guidelines:
- Do NOT try to open the doors.
- Default to False. Set "up"/"down" ONLY when physically on a staircase crossing between floors. Flat ground, ramps, thresholds, a single step, or carpet edges are all False.
- Set stop=true whenever you have reached the target described in the instruction. The
  TODO list does NOT gate stopping — you may stop regardless of how many pending items remain.
- Focus on following the text instruction.
