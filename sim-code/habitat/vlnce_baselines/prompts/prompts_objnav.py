decide the next action to find the target object. If appropriate, suggest incremental updates to the TODO list.

Current TODO List:
{todo_list}

{feedback}

Task:
1. FIRST, write `reasoning_todo`: review ALL TODO items (not just the first one) and
   decide what to update. Items have only two statuses: "pending" and "completed".
   Sub-goals may be completed out of order or implicitly as you navigate.
   - If yes: in `todo_updates`, mark it `completed` with a concrete `result` describing
     the observation that confirms completion (e.g., "Saw kitchen through archway at
     Waypoint 3").
   - IMPORTANT: If you mark a LATER item `completed`, re-examine EARLIER items —
     they may have been done implicitly while you traversed.
   - If an item no longer matches what you see, use `op:rewrite` to refine it.
   - If a new sub-goal emerges, `op:add` it; omit `index` to append at the end, or
     include `index` to inject at that position (later items shift down).
   - If an item turns out to be irrelevant / unreachable, `op:remove` it.
   - `completed` WITHOUT a concrete `result` will be rolled back.

2. THEN, write `reasoning_action` and choose the next action based on the UPDATED TODO
   plus what you observe.

Guidelines:

- Set stop=true whenever you have visual confirmation of the target within ~1m. The TODO
  list does NOT gate stopping — you may stop regardless of how many pending items remain.
- Focus on finding the target object specified in the task.

Each waypoint in the history (e.g., "Waypoint 0", "Waypoint 1") is a potential candidate.

Analysis:
1. **Target Identification**: Is the "{target_object}" visible in any current view?
2. **Room Type Inference**: Based on objects seen, where are you? Is the target likely here?
3. **Exploration**: If target is not seen, choose a direction that leads to a *new* area or a room likely to contain the target.

Choose one of these actions:
1. navigate to forward - continue straight ahead

  - When to STOP (stopping condition) according to the instruction.
- Do NOT refer to step indices, images, or past actions.
- Use generic wording that remains valid throughout the whole episode.

1. Exit the current room by turning around and passing through the doorway.  
2. Turn left and exit the next door encountered.
